# ZUSofHearts

ZUSofHearts is a static frontend MVP for a Hearthstone-style card game themed around Poland’s social insurance (ZUS). It’s pure **HTML + CSS** and includes the full board UI: top/bottom HUD, life track, side panels, opponent hub, a “rail” hand with hover reveal, and overlays (event/decision/mulligan/result/tutorial).

**Open `index.html` to run**; 
customize palette/scale via `css/brand-zus.css` and `css/board-scale.css`, and supply gameplay values through simple `data-*` attributes.
